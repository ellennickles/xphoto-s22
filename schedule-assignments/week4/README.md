# Feb 16 • Week 4 • Alternative Shutter Buttons 1

>A short time since the Scientific American briefly noted the fact that Mr. Muybridge, of San Francisco, had perfected an **automatic electro-photo-graphic apparatus**, by means of which he had succeeded in recording the action of horses in motion…. In taking the negatives of these photographs, **Mr. Muybridge employed a series of cameras, operated by electricity**, and so placed as to fix with absolute accuracy the several phases in the continuous action of the horse while making one stride. The exposure for each negative was about the two thousandth part of a second. (“A Horse’s Motion Scientifically Determined”, *California Farmer and Journal of Useful Sciences*, Volume 48, Number 17, 24 October 1878) (emphasis mine)

## Questions
- What are alternative ways to trigger the capture of photographs?
- How can we start to work with sensors that are measuring changes in the physical world as shutter buttons?

## Assignment due Tuesday • Feb 22 • 11:59pm
### PART 1 • EXPERIMENT & REFLECT (PARTNERS OPTIONAL)
- Continue to work in **black and white** again. Take a series of images triggered by a sensor on your Arduino or similar microcontroller. Is the sensor triggering the capture the result of a change (or inactivity) in the environment or in response to an action (or reaction) of the body? Is the triggering active or passive? How does the choice of sensor and its context in the world contribute to the intentions or expressions of the image? The only rule is: no buttons or toggle switches on your Arduino to trigger captures.
- Choose one of the images to post on your blog, along with a link to the code. Write a short reflection on your process and results. What does the image show? Why do you like the image? What qualities do you like best (see [Elements of a Photograph](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s22/blob/main/resources/photograph-elements.md))? What did you have trouble with? What would you do differently next time? Describe the experience of creating the images? What did you feel? What was surprising, enjoyable, or challenging?
- If you work with a partner, each person still needs to submit a blog post.

### PART 2 • [READ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1YZtWK03TXGCoGmy7WeQYF-BBulZFAbHA) & RESPOND
- Read “Color Theory for Photographers: An Introduction” by Chelsea London, 2018. Click the link above for the PDF or read an online version with animations [here](https://medium.com/@pixelmagazine/color-theory-for-photographers-an-introduction-ae23296fda6d).
- Let's start talking about color. You can find a great deal of information online about color theory for photographers, but the above is an approachable and comprehensive overview. Following the examples in the reading, find or photograph (using any camera you want) images for each of these color schemes: monochrome, analogous, and complimentary. 
- Post the three images on your blog along with a short description about how color contributes the composition. How does color move your eye through or around the images? Does color contribute to the mood or energy of an image for you? Does it work to empahsize a particular aspect of the photograph? (If you use others' images, be sure to give credit and link back to the source!)
- Include at least one (1) question for discussion or further reflection.
