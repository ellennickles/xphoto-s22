# Feb 9 • Week 3 • Multiple Cameras

>A photograph, while recording what has been seen, always and by its nature refers to what is not seen. It isolates, preserves, and presents a moment taken from a continuum…. The only decision [the photographer] can take is as regards the moment [they] choose to isolate. Yet this apparent limitation gives the photograph its unique power. What it shows invokes what is not shown. (John Berger, *Understanding a Photograph*, 1968)

## Questions
- What is Cartier-Bresson’s “decisive moment”? 
- How can we work with multiple cameras in p5 to capture a moment from multiple angles simultaneously?

## In class
- Practice Questions for Discovery
- Homework review
- Discuss the "decisive moment"
- Workshop: Multiple Cameras, Simultaneous Captures

## Assignment due Tuesday • Feb 15 • 11:59pm

### PART 1 • EXPERIMENT & REFLECT
- Capture multiple images of a scene from **at least two different angles** (or more!) simultaneously and in **black and white**. 
- Maybe play with cause and effect, action and reaction, before and after? Or something completely different. Is the scene from a story, a mystery, a sensation? Is it a spontaneous or planned event? Consider the five senses, e.g. is it a loud moment or a quiet one? 
- Consider how you want to display the final photographs. The arrangement can be completely different from how you drew the photos to the Canvas at moment of capture, i.e. you can configure them as you see fit for the work on your blog.
- Post the images on your blog and write a short reflection on your process and results. What do the images show? Why do you like the images? What qualities do you like best (see [Elements of a Photograph](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s22/blob/main/resources/photograph-elements.md))? What did you have trouble with? What would you do differently next time? Describe the experience of creating the images? What did you feel? What was surprising, enjoyable, or challenging?

### PART 2 • [READ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1YZtWK03TXGCoGmy7WeQYF-BBulZFAbHA) & RESPOND
- Read “The Annihilation of Time and Space” in *River of Shadows* by Rebecca Solnit, pp. 1-24  
- Did anything surprise you about this reading? What do you want to know more about? It's been about 150 years since Muybridge’s Horse in Motion series, and now electricity and photography are ubiquitous. What currently emerging technologies do you predict could become prevelant in the future?

### PREPARE FOR **NEXT WEEK** and WEEK 5 (Feb 16 and Feb 23)
- During these weeks, we'll use physical computing to create alternative shutter buttons. Here's a checklist to prepare. Especially with current global supply chain issues and shipping delays, please don't wait until the last minute. 
- Gather the following materials
    - Arduino (Uno or Nano 33 IoT depending on when you took Creative Computing)
    - Cables to connect your Arduino to you computer
    - Solderless breadboard
    - Jumper wires
    - Sensor(s) with which you have previous experience or are excited to use (but no buttons or toggle switches!)
    - Resistors and other components required for use with sensor(s) (check The Shop bins!)
    - The [ITP/IMA Equipment Room (ER)]( https://itp.nyu.edu/er/) (NYU login required) lists some Arduinos and accessorie, but head over to The Shop to check them out.
- Install the following apps
    - [Arduino IDE v1.8.15 or later](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (but not 2.0)
    - [p5.serialcontrol](https://github.com/p5-serial/p5.serialcontrol/releases) (for Macs: Beta 1.2 > Assets > p5.serialcontrol-darwin-x64.zip)
- Install and test your Arduino
    - [Arduino Nano 33 IoT Quickstart Guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-33-iot)
    - [Arduino Uno Quickstart Guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-rev3)
- Review microcontroller basics, pin functions, breadboard layouts, and the lab on serial input to p5.js posted in Resources > Technical Resources > [Physical Computing](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s22/blob/main/resources/technical-resources.md#physical-computing)
