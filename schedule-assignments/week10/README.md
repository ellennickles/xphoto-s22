# Apr 6 • Week 10 • Composite Operations in p5.js

>Digital photographs function in an entirely different way from traditional photographs. Or do they? Shall we accept that digital imaging represents a radical rupture with photography? Is an image, mediated by computer and electronic
technology, radically different from an image obtained through a photographic lens and embodied in film? If we describe film-based images using such categories as depth of field, zoom, a shot or montage, what categories should be used to describe digital images? Shall the phenomenon of digital imaging force us to rethink such fundamental concepts as realism or representation? (Lev Manovich, ["Paradoxes of Digital Photography"](http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/paradoxes-of-digital-photography), 1994)

>The Layers feature was added to Photoshop 3.0, released in 1994. To quote Photoshop Help, "Layers allow you to work on one element of an image without disturbing the others." From the point of view of media theory, however, the Layers feature is much more than that. It redefines both how images are created and what an "image" actually means. What used to be an indivisible whole becomes a composite of separate parts (Lev Manovich, [Inside Photoshop](http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/inside-photoshop), 2011)

## Questions
- What are some additional composite operations in p5.js (in addition to those from Week 7) to create and shoot compositions?
- With this in mind, what else can we learn about digital photographic media and its possibilities by programming our own software?


## In class
- Share and discuss our GANs' inference results
- Compositing demos: pixel regions and layers + masks
- Related work
- Prepare for next week's field trip to the International Center of Photography (ICP)

## Assignment due Tuesday • Apr 12 • 11:59pm 
### PART 1 • EXPERIMENT & REFLECT 
- Explore the compositing techniques this week by creating portrait of yourself or someone else. You are free to interpret the idea of a portrait however you wish. Some of you have already created self-portraits this semester but these techniques provide further options for a literally layering of ideas. Consider experimenting by configuring your camera lens through layers that you code in p5. 
- If you're stuck on how to start, here's a self-portrait assignment from [Janet Delaney](http://www.janetdelaney.com/) from *The Photographer's Playbook*. Feel free to adapt this to plan a portrait of someone else if you go that route.
    1. Write ten nouns that best describe you.
    2. Now write ten adjectives.
    3. Add ten verbs to the list.
    > Each word should be a direct reflection of how you feel about yourself at this specific moment. The last few words at the end of each list might become fairly abstract. You may find yourself reading past the initial ideas and into words that are more fanciful, more honest, and perhaps more problematic. Use this list of words as a way to enter into the making of the photograph. Remember, be alone with your camera. No one else can click the shutter for you.
- Post the portrait on your blog along with a link to your code and write a short reflection on your process and results. What qualities do you like best (see [Elements of a Photograph](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s22/blob/main/resources/photograph-elements.md))? What did you have trouble with? What would you do differently next time? Describe the experience of creating the portrait? What was surprising, enjoyable, or challenging?

### PART 2 • [READ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1YZtWK03TXGCoGmy7WeQYF-BBulZFAbHA) & RESPOND
- Read Ian Walker's "Through the Picture Plane: On Looking into Photographs", from *The Photography Reader: History and Theory, 2nd edtion*, edited by Liz Wells, pp. 150-160.
- Next week is all about looking at photographs in different contexts than we have so far in this course: on gallery walls and in print books as opposed to the digital screens in our classroom. Walker asks, “How do issues around size, framing, and installation affect our response to the images? Indeed, how does the physical situation we find ourselves in — walking around the communal space of the gallery, moving bodily towards and away from images — affect our imaginative response in ways that are radically different from our usually solitary and sedentary response to the picture on the page?" Is a photograph changed by its context?
- For a clearer reference, here is the Walker Evans photograph mentioned in the reading, "[Houses and Billboards in Atlanta 1936](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/50265)", currently on view at MoMA, New York. 
- Include at least one (1) question for discussion or further reflection.

### EXTRA CREDIT (2 points) • RESEARCH
- There are works by 40 artists at ICP's currente exhibit, [A Trillion Sunsets • A Century of Image Overload](https://www.icp.org/exhibitions/a-trillion-sunsets). Research one of the [artists](https://collectordaily.com/a-trillion-sunsets-a-century-of-image-overload-icp/). What kinds of themes does their work expore? In their work, to which images do you have the strongest reponse and why? Does their work relate to any of the topics of this class or does it ask difference questions about photography and photographic expression? If so, how? 
- You are welcome to include this research in the same blog post for this week.
