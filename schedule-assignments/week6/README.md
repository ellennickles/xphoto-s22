# Mar 2 • Week 6 • Internet Photography

>...the networked image is data, that is: visual information to be analysed and remapped to new contexts via algorithms. (Daniel Rubenstein and Katrina Sluis, "[A Life More Photographic; Mapping the Networked Image](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299854265_A_Life_More_Photographic_Mapping_The_Networked_Image)," 2008)

## Questions
- Is anything at stake when algorithms label images? 
- What are ways that photographs online are connected to each other?

## Assignment due Tuesday • Mar 8 • 11:59pm
### PART 1 • EXPERIMENT & REFLECT 
- Curate a collection of five (5) to eight (8) images found on the internet. Use a different method from the in-class exercise. Be intentional and critical about why you are selecting the images and how you arrange them. How are the images connected to one another? How does grouping these particular images alter or extend the meanings of the individual images? Refer to the examples in the [slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1YZtWK03TXGCoGmy7WeQYF-BBulZFAbHA) from class for inspiration or come up with a new theme. Will the collection be a sequence or a series? 
- Not sure which images to include in your edit? See [Is it alive? On seeing what is right in front of you...](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s22/blob/main/resources/is-it-alive.md) by Joanne Dugan.
- Post the images on your blog, and write a short reflection on your process and results. What do the images show? Why do you like them? What qualities do you like best (see [Elements of a Photograph](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s22/blob/main/resources/photograph-elements.md))? What did you have trouble with? What would you do differently next time? Describe the experience of finding and selecting the images? Do you feel like a photographer? What was surprising, enjoyable, or challenging?
### PART 2 • [WATCH](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1YZtWK03TXGCoGmy7WeQYF-BBulZFAbHA) & RESPOND
- Watch "Surrealism Beyond Borders Virtual Opening" from The Metropolitan Museum of Art ~27min
- Listen to "Surrealism and Psychology” by Grace Pailthorpe ~15min
- The term "automatism" is mentioned in both videos. What does it mean in the context of Surrealism? 
- Include at least one (1) question for discussion or further reflection. 

### SUBMIT • [Submit your blog post here](https://forms.gle/JfwCTv7JqkieZ8yz8)

### PREPARE FOR NEXT WEEK (Mar 9)
