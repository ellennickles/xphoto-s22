# Mar 16 • Week 8 • Generative Images 1 • Datasets

>Machine learning is programming with examples, not instructions. (Kyle McDonald, *[Weird Intelligence](https://vimeo.com/304110435)*, KIKK Festival 2018)

## Questions
- What are Generative Advesarial Networks (GANs) and how do they generate images?
- Using tools that are familiar to us in this class, what are some ways to create and prepare large image datasets to train a GAN?

## In class
- Homework review (in small groups)
- Generative images, introduction and overview
- Creating / preparing datasets
- (Preview) Train a GAN in Google Colab

## Assignment due Tuesday • Mar 29 • 11:59pm

### PART 1 • EXPERIMENT & REFLECT 
- Create a dataset of ~1000+ images (1000-5000 is better), but at least 500 minimum. More images in your dataset requires more model training time but will likely increase the "clarity" of your generated images. Prepare your images according to the [Dataset Considerations / Checklist](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WpioRMdfNUe8VOUs9iuKE3gd2mPonSFKFMRx-MedpKM/edit#slide=id.g11e35fd12b0_6_20). 
- Depending on your goal, creating and preparing an image dataset of this size can take time; in other words, start well before the night the assignment is due. 
- Store your dataset in Google Drive and provide a link to it from your blog post.
- Also a save a local copy of the entire dataset on your computer so that it is ready to use in class next week.
### PART 2 • [READ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1YZtWK03TXGCoGmy7WeQYF-BBulZFAbHA) & RESPOND
- Read "In the Age of A.I., Is Seeing Still Believing?" by Joshua Rothman, *New Yorker*, November 12, 2018 Issue.
- The photo-forensics expert in this article explains that, "Modern digital cameras...often achieve higher resolutions by guessing about the light their sensors don’t catch. 'Essentially, they cheat... Two-thirds of the image isn’t recorded—it’s synthesized!'" Some questions to ponder: At such a high percentage, is the difference between a photograph taken with a modern digital camera and one that is completely computer-generated significant? If it looks like a photograph and functions like a photograph, then does it matter how it was made? *Is seeing still believing?* What makes a photograph "trustworthy"?
- Include at least one (1) question for discussion or further reflection.

### EXTRA CREDIT (2 points) • RESEARCH
- Research an artist not mentioned in class who uses GANs in their work. What type of work do they make? Include and analyze some examples. Why does this artist choose to work with this tool? Include a position, opinion, and/or proposal that does not merely summarize what the artist or others have said, but represents your own thoughts even if they are tentative. For example, what question(s) do you have about their work?
- You are welcome to include this research in the same blog post for this week.

### PREPARE FOR NEXT WEEK (MAR 30)
- Next week we will use Google Colaboratory, or Colab, to run code in the browser to train a machine learning model to generate images. For our purposes, our Colab account requires a Google Drive plan with a large amount of storage space, which we already have through NYU (at least through 2024).
- Log into your NYU Google Drive account, then sign up for [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/signup). Google Colab Pro is highly recommended at $10.88 per month with taxes. This is a monthly recurring charge, but the subscription is easy to cancel at any time.
- We will only use Colab for one week, however you may decide to continue to use it for your final project.
