# Apr 13 • Week 11 • ICP Field Trip / Final Project Description

>Are there too many images in the world? Too many of the wrong kind? Too many that we don’t like or want or need? These feel like very contemporary questions, but they have a rich and fascinating history. [A Trillion Sunsets: A Century of Image Overload](https://www.icp.org/exhibitions/a-trillion-sunsets) takes a long look at our worries and compulsive fascination with the proliferation of photographic images... In the 1920s, with the rapid increase in illustrated magazines and daily newspapers, commentators asked whether society could survive the visual inundation. Artists looked to mass-media imagery and archives of all kinds to rethink the world around them... From scrapbooks to internet memes, from collage and image appropriation to art made by algorithms, A Trillion Sunsets highlights unlikely parallels and connections across distinct decades. (Exhibit at [ICP](https://www.icp.org/), Jan 28 – May 2, 2022)

## Questions
- How is looking at photographs on gallery walls and in print books different from digital screens? In this new context, what do you notice or consider that you haven't before?
- Many of the works presented in ICP's A Trillion Sunsets exhibit are photomontages. Can you tell where the source material is from? How were they collected? Who is the audience? How does image appropriation break the boundary of "straight photography"?

## ICP field trip logistics and class schedulue
- [Museum location, transportation, and entrance requirements](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s22/tree/main/schedule-assignments/week10#prepare-for-next-week-apr-13)
- 2:30pm - 2:45pm • Meet as a class in ICP lobby
- 2:45pm - 4:00pm • Explore the exhibits (on the 2nd and 3rd floor) and bookstore (1st floor) on your own
- 4:00pm - 4:20pm • Meet as a class to discuss final projects

## Final project description
- **Schedule** • Your final project for this course is a three (3) week assignment to be completed in three (3) stages: 
    - Proposal (due Week 12)
    - Prototype to share in class for feedback (due Week 13)
    - Presentation of the completed project (due Week 14)  
- **Project Description** • This is an open-ended creative project that builds off or is inspired by the course topics. It can also veer into a new direction that we haven't explored together (some ideas below). 
    - You are expected to push your abilities to produce something that utilizes what you have learned, continues to explore questions you encountered during the course, and/or asks new questions about the nature of photography.
    - The final project is worth 20% of your final course grade (5% proposal, 5% prototype, 10% implementation and presentation).
- **Additional Notes**
    - Final projects can be collaborations with anyone in any class. 
    - Final projects can be one part of a larger project integrated with a different class.
    - Keeping things simple and small in scope is a plus. If your project idea is a big one, consider documenting the larger idea but implementing just a small piece of it.
    - Also think about making a final project for a small audience, even one single person like a family member or friend. . . or yourself. This can be a good way to focus your idea and design process. "Generalizing" the idea can come later (or maybe not at all).
- **Possible Ideas** • This is a brand new course for IMA, and especially because there are no prior projects to share, I encourage you to dream big and run wild with ideas. If you need inspiration, consider looking back at the record of questions you asked in your blog posts. Here are some possible directions, but you can also explore something entirely different!
    - **Make a book or zine** • Continue to develop one of your experiments from this semester and make book or zine of a sequence or series of photographs. There is a strong tradition of photobooks in photography. For context and direction, Jon Nicholls from the Thomas Tallis School created a useful lesson to answer the questions: [What is a photobook? Why has it been such an important part of the history of photography? How do you make one?](https://www.photopedagogy.com/the-photobook.html) The book or zine can take the form of a print or digital publication. If you go this route, aim to bring a mock-up to class during Week 13 to share for feedback. 
     - **Create an experimental online or XR gallery** • Continue to develop one of your experiments from this semester and present them on a website, Miro board?, or another platform that engages viewers in an unexpected ways. Are the images interactive, animated, temporary? Is there a specific sequence or nonlinear narrative? What images and details can we see or not see an at given moment? How does the flow and engagement with images connect to the larger ideas explored in the collection of images? If you go this route, aim to bring a mock-up to class during Week 13 to share for feedback. 
    - **Train another StyleGAN2-ADA model** • Building off what we learned from this assignment as a class, create a large, diverse dataset of images (or expand your original one) to train for an extended amount of time in order to create a sequence or series of generated images. If you go this route, aim to bring some examples of generated images to class during Week 13 to share for feedback.
    - **Make an opinionated photobooth** • We might expect a traditional photobook to fire off a succession of captures within a short amount of time after a brief countdown. How can you disrupt this idea? Is there an alternative shutter button? Does the photobooth wait patiently for the user to engage in a particular way? Or does it have a mind of its own? [Possible inspiration?](https://www.rencontres-arles.com/en/expositions/view/700/shoot) If you go this route, aim to bring a working prototype to class during Week 13 to share for feedback.
    - **Make a physical (interactive?) object or installation** • How can you push the ideas of photography through alternative physical forms? If you enjoy fabrication, then you might be interested these contemporary photographers whose work asks this question, often creating sculptural photographic objects.

These examples, however, are not necessarily interactive. How can physical interaction alter how we engage with images? If you go this route, aim to bring a working prototype to class during Week 13 to share for feedback. (*Works are spread across collectiions so Wikipedia entries are provided as a starting point.)
    - These are just some ideas to get started. If you are unsure what to do, contact me and we'll brainstorm some ideas together. 

## Assignment due Wednesday • Apr 20 • Start of class

### Final Project Proposals
#### PART 1 • RESEARCH YOUR IDEA
- Next week (Week 12) you'll share you project idea and plan, and also ask our class questions for feedback. A best you can, describe what you intend to make and also the steps necessary to realize your idea. 
- Here are some suggestions of what to collect:
    - **Title and description** • Do you have an idea for a working title and/or a brief description of the final deliverable?
    - **Concepts** • Is there a theme, topic, question, or interaction driving your vision for the project?
    - **Inspirations** • How and why did you become interested in this idea? Reference any relevant projects, products, people, media, events, experiences, dreams, etc.   
    - **Source material** • Do you have any drawings, images, videos, text, etc. to help make sense of your idea?
    - **Context/Audience** • Is there a story? Who is this for? How will people experience it? What kind of experience would you like people to have?
    - **Production** • What technical steps will you need to take to realize your idea? 
    - **Code** • If you project uses code, do you have links to past projects, other people's projects, or examples?
    - **Questions for your classmates** • What are you unsure of conceptually, creatively, or technically? On what aspect(s) would you like feedback?
#### PART 2 • PREPARE A PRESENTATION
- Write a blog post to share with the class in a four (4)-min presentation. Use the list above as an outline to illustrate what’s in your head.
- If you are collaborating with a partner or group, everyone is still expected to write a post and present for four (4) minutes each.
- This assignment is worth five (5) points: four (4) for describing your project proposal using relevant aspects of the list above and one (1) for submitting the post on time.
