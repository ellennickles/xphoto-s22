# Looking at Photographs

Select a photograph. Look at it closely and thoughtfully for 30 seconds. (Time yourself: it will feel much longer than you expect.) Then use these questions to practice identifying photographic elements while looking at and analyzing the picture. Copy the questions into a blog post and write your responses quickly and freely. Skip those that are too hard and come back to them later. Refer to the [Elements of a Photograph]() if you need to for additional reference. This activity should take about 20 minutes. There are no right or wrong answers. 

These questions are adapted from [Marvin Bartel’s Art Teacher Guides](https://www.bartelart.com/) and [Focus on Photography: A Curriculum Guide](https://www.icp.org/content/focus-on-photography) by Cynthia Way for the International Center of Photography, 2006. 

## First Impressions
- Let ten (10) details that you see in the photograph.
- What else do you see?

## Composition
- Look away and then look at the photograph again. What catches your eyes first? 
- Why does it stand out? e.g. describe the shapes, lines, colors, patterns, etc.
- What do you see next? 
- Why do your eyes go there?

## Techniques & Attributes
- What is the quality of the lighting? Is it soft and diffused or hard and contrasty? What is the direction of the light, i.e. where is it coming from?
- Describe what is in focus. Is any part of the picture clear or blurry?
- What is the photographer’s point of view? Where was the photographer when they took the picture? Below the subject? Above? Close? Far away?

## Content
- What is the subject of the photograph? What/who is in the picture?
- What is behind the subject (background)? What is in front (foreground)? 
- What is the setting? Where was the picture taken? Time period? Time of day?
What questions do you have about the subject?

## Style & Genre
- Use an adjective to describe the style of the subject.
- Can you guess what genre this photograph represents? What makes you say that?

## Meaning
- What is the mood of the photograph? How does it make you feel? What does the photograph make you think of? 
- What do you think the photographer made these artistic choices?
- What do you think the photograph is saying?

## Last Impressions
- Look once more at the photograph and find something else you haven’t described yet. Describe it.
- Is there a “decisive moment” in the image? Why or why not?
- What is your reaction to this exercise? Did anything surprise you?

## Self-assessment
- What questions were difficult to answer? Techniques and attributes? Composition? Content? Style and genre? Meaning?
