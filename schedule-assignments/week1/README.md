# Jan 26 • Week 1 • What is photography?

>The enemy of photography is the convention, the fixed rules of "how to do." The salvation of photography comes from the experiment. ([Lászlo Moholy-Nagy](https://photographyandvision.com/2021/03/15/monday-photography-inspiration-laszlo-moholy-nagy/), 1940)

## Questions
- In what ways can we start to describe photography?
- How do photographs function in our lives?
- How has photography changed since it started?
- What does experimental mean in this course?

## Assignment due Tuesday • Feb 1 • 11:59pm

### PART 0 • SET UP
- **Blog** • Make sure that you have a blog or website set up for this course to post and share your homework (a Google Doc will work, too). If you’re not sure what platform to use, please reach out to me for help.
- **p5** • Create a free [p5 web editor account](https://editor.p5js.org/) (if you don’t already have one).
- **Miro** • Create a free [Miro account](https://miro.com/signup/) (you can use any email address).
- **USB to USB-C adapter** • If your computer doesn't have USB ports, make sure you have a USB to USB-C adapter to use with external webcams for at least the next two weeks ([see note](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s22#cameras))

### PART 1 • SELECT & REFLECT
- Select a photograph that you did not take but enjoy looking at or is of the type of imagery that you would like to know more about. Write a blog post, include the image, and describe what you see in the work. What does the image show? Does it tell a story? What qualities do you like best? What does it express? What choices did the photographer make to achieve these impressions and expressions? Why do you imagine the photograph was created? 
- Be prepared to share and talk about the image in our next class. 

### PART 2 • [READ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1YZtWK03TXGCoGmy7WeQYF-BBulZFAbHA) & RESPOND
- [The Rules](http://manifestos.mombartz.com/immaculate-heart-college-art-department-rules/) by [Sister Corita Kent](https://www.corita.org/) (1967-1968)
- [The Photographer’s Right](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1YZtWK03TXGCoGmy7WeQYF-BBulZFAbHA) by Bert P. Krages II (2016)
- [ITP/IMA Code of Conduct](https://itpnyu.github.io/ITP-IMA-Code-of-Conduct/index) 
- Our class engages in experimental practices and also provides space to share our work, engage with that of others, and cultivate ways of collaboratively providing feedback to promote awareness and discovery in our creative practices (i.e. what creative decisions are we making). We’ll talk more about this in class next week. To get started, based on the readings above and on your own experiences, in the same blog post write about ways to foster a class community in which it is safe to experiment with ideas and materials and to share our results with one another.

### PREPARE FOR WEEKS 4-5 (Feb 16 and Feb 23)
- During these weeks we'll use physical computing to create alternative shutter buttons. Here's a checklist to prepare. Especially with global supply chain issues and shipping delays these days, please don't wait until the last minute. 
- Gather the following materials
    - Arduino (Uno or Nano 33 IoT depending on when you took Creative Computing)
    - Cables to connect your Arduino to you computer
    - Solderless breadboard
    - Jumper wires
    - Sensor(s) with which you have previous experience or are excited to use (but no buttons or toggle switches!)
    - Resistors and other components required for use with sensor(s) (check The Shop bins!)
    - The [ITP/IMA Equipment Room (ER)]( https://itp.nyu.edu/er/) (NYU login required) has some Arduinos and accessories available to check out
- Install the following apps
    - [Arduino IDE v1.8.15 or later](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (but not 2.0)
    - [p5.serialcontrol](https://github.com/p5-serial/p5.serialcontrol/releases) (for Macs: Beta 1.2 > Assets > p5.serialcontrol-darwin-x64.zip)
- Install and test your Arduino
    - [Arduino Uno Quickstart Guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-rev3)
    - [Arduino Nano 33 IoT Quickstart Guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-33-iot)
