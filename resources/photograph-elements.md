# Elements of a Photograph
Photographers make many decisions when they are working, whether they are aware of all of them or not. They make choices about design (technical and formal/compositional qualities) and content (subject, style, and meaning). This list was compiled and adapted from [Focus on Photography: A Curriculum Guide](https://www.icp.org/content/focus-on-photography) by Cynthia Way for the International Center of Photography, 2006. 

We don’t have to consider all of these when making or reflecting on photographs, but these are some ideas to get us started. We are also welcome to modify this list!

## Techniques & Attributes
### Light
What is the type and quality of light? Is the light natural (e.g., from the sun) or artificial (e.g.,
from a lamp, flash, studio strobe)? How does the type/source of lighting affect the look of the image? 
What is the direction? Is the lighting coming from above, below, the side? At what angle? Are there any shadows? Does the direction of the light create an effect of dimension? Is the light soft or hard? Are the shadows thin or thick? Do light and shadow make a pattern?

### Focus
Areas of focus are clear, sharp, and detailed, with distinctions between forms. When out of focus, the area is cloudy, indistinct, and vague, with blurriness between forms. What can you see clearly in the picture? What is unclear? How does focus capture our attention? Can sharp focus capture our attention as well as blurry focus can? As a result of focus, does the subject gain or lose significance?

### Time
Images are created during a particular moment. Describe the sense of time that comes across in the image. Does it seem like a fleeting instant captured in a snapshot (e.g., a person walking down a chaotic street) or does it carry the timeless quality of a painting (e.g., a couple standing still for a portrait)?

### Motion
In a photograph, motion can appear frozen in time and space or be described through blur. Is anything moving in the picture? How can you tell?

### Vantage point/point of view
This is the photographer’s stance, both in terms of how the photographer is positioned when they take the picture and what the photographer’s attitude is toward the subject. How the photographer perceives the subject influences how the photographer chooses to position themselves in relation to the subject. This is similar to how your opinion about something affects the tone of your voice and the language you use to communicate. Where was the photographer when he or she took the picture? Was the photographer standing or crouching or lying on the
Ground? Did the photographer take the picture from above, below, or the side? Did the photographer tilt the camera or keep it parallel to the horizon? Can you guess what the photographer’s attitude is toward the subject? How does the vantage point affect the way you look at the resulting picture? For example, a picture taken from above may give the impression of superiority, from below of inferiority, and a host of other interpretations.

### Framing
Whenever photographers create a photograph, they are selecting a slice of the world as described through a frame. In terms of content, framing is like a point of view: It presents the photographer’s frame of reference with regard to the subject. Graphically, framing affects
composition, because your eye follows the visual movement created by lines, shapes, and angles in the picture. In addition, the information that is included in the frame determines how we read the picture, just like how clues lead to the solution of a mystery. What is included in the frame, and what is excluded?

### Cropping
Sometimes when photographers frame a photograph, they crop or exclude from the frame a portion of the subject, foreground, or background. The frame may cut off the man’s hat, an arm, or half of a chair. To make sense of the image, viewers don’t need to see the whole person or object because there is enough information to imagine the rest beyond the frame. Cropping calls attention to the fact that you are looking at an artist’s selection of a scene. Used effectively, cropping can add dynamism to the composition or make the photographic statement more concise. Used ineffectively, we may wonder what’s missing, why the image looks awkward, its message unclear. What effect does cropping have on the graphic composition of the
Image? How does cropping help draw attention to what the photograph is saying? How does cropping affect your perception of the subject?

## Composition
### Shape
These are definite forms created by objects, figures, and shadows. They are rendered in colors or shades of gray. Can you find different shapes in the image? Look for circles, squares, rectangles, triangles, and organic forms. Look in the shadows for more shapes and echoes of shapes. Think about how the shapes in the image create balance and structure.

### Line
Lines are the borders between shapes. Let your eyes follow the lines in the image. Or make a drawing of the outlines of shapes. What qualities do the lines have: strong and bold; light and thin; curvy or straight; diagonal or circular? Think about the effect that the quality of the lines has on your visual experience of the image: Is it activating, calming, or unifying?

### Angle
Angles draw our attention in certain directions. Study the angles created by the intersection of lines and shapes in the image. Point out the direction of the angles. What do they lead your eyes
toward? Do they draw your attention in or out of the frame?

### Color and tone
A color photograph can offer a range of the visual spectrum of colors, but not all the colors that the eye can see. Some photographers pay attention to creating a color palette, or a pattern of complementary and contrasting colors, just like in a painting. The tones in a black-and-white
photograph are the various shades of gray from white to black, and they can be bright or pale.
Describe the colors or tones in the photograph. Do you see patterns of colors or tones?
How do the colors or tones make you feel?

### Pattern
Patterns of visual forms—shapes, lines, colors or tones, light and shadow—create balance and structure in a composition and also can emphasize the main ideas of the photograph. What types of patterns can you find in the image? Can you find any repeated shapes or colors? Does this pattern create rhythm and emphasis? (Think of patterns in music.) Describe the quality of the pattern: loud, quiet, busy, delicate, heavy. What does the pattern draw your attention to?

### Depth
Depth in a photograph is an illusion created by the way forms are rendered on a two-dimensional surface. Perspective (point of view) creates a sense of depth, especially when it results in a composition with lines and angles that draw your attention to a distant point. A sense of depth also comes from areas of light and shadow and the clarity of detail or focus. Photographers use perspective, composition, lighting, and focus to create a three-dimensional effect. Does the photograph look flat and two-dimensional, with the forms appearing to be on the same plane? Or does it seem like a three-dimensional world into which you could slip? Do you feel like you could hold the objects in your hand? Consider the relationship between forms by comparing the size of different elements in the image. What seems close up or far away? What is clear or blurry? Are there areas of light and shadow in the image? Is the light creating a sense of depth?

### Overall composition
What are the relationships between all the above elements that you observe? Taken together, the shapes, lines, angles, colors and tones, patterns, and depth of the image create the composition. Figures and objects in the image are considered the “positive space” of the composition. Consider the “negative space,” too—this is the part of the image between the actual forms and the frame: the white sky or the gray floor, for example. Study how the composition keeps your eye busy with its shapes, lines, and angles. Where is your eye drawn? Look at the way the forms work together. Consider the shape that several forms, like three people in a triangular formation, make together. Is there a prominent shape or diagonal in the composition? What are the main elements of the composition? A pattern, figures, color? What are the complementary elements? Shadow, background? Overall, does the composition lead your attention to one thing or to many things? Does the composition “work,” effectively contributing to the meaning?

## Content
### Subject
All the visual elements draw the viewer’s attention to the concrete subject (what is literally portrayed, what you see in the image) and the abstract subject (the main idea that the photographer is trying to communicate, what you interpret). Sometimes the subject of art is an idea; in conceptual art, the idea often is the point of the artwork. In narrative art, the subject portrays a story or part of a story with the rest implied. In figurative art, the subject is the person, place, or thing that is represented. The genre of the artwork is a good clue to the abstract
idea that the artist is addressing. What is your eye drawn to? What is the main idea that the picture makes you think of? Describe what you see in the picture that gives you
information about the subject and main idea.

### Background
The background creates a context for the photograph. It can be a color, a blurry shape, or a highly detailed scene. Color creates a mood. Details offer hints about the subject. The background provides valuable information on how to interpret the photograph because it
sets the context. What do you see in the background? Do you see mainly colors or shapes? What effect do they create? Do you see details? Describe them. How does the background connect to the subject?

### Foreground
The foreground is the area in front of the subject. It also contains valuable information that reflects the subject, and it can affect the mood of the image and the access the viewer has to the subject. Space in the foreground can create a feeling of distance from the subject. Shading in the foreground can create dimension. Activity or cropped forms can add dynamism to the composition, even a sense of mystery. Sometimes there is nothing in the foreground, giving you direct access to the subject. Describe what you see in front of the subject. What effect does the foreground have on how you see the subject?

### People 
If there are people pictured, what observations can you make about the following? Action: What are the people doing? What is the purpose of the action? Motivation: Can you guess why they are doing it? Expression: Describe their expression. Can you guess what they are feeling? Clothing: Describe what they are wearing. What can you learn about them through their clothing? Can you guess where they work or what they like to do? What age are they? Where are they from? What time period are they from?

### Story
Photographs are a wonderful tool for storytelling. They capture a moment in time that can be the beginning, middle, or end of a story. In a photograph, you can often see a character in a situation that poses a question or presents a mystery leading to a story. For a single image, what is happening in this photograph? What might have happened before the photograph was taken? What might happen next? Also consider what else you know about the people, setting, situation/plot, or time period. How does your knowledge add to the story? 

### Mood/feeling
Many attributes of a photograph can create mood: lighting; the colors and tones; the shapes, lines, and angles. Colors inspire an emotional reaction: Some colors in the blue family seem cool and in the red family, hot. Mood is connoted by visual elements but depends on each person’s
subjective response. How does this picture make you feel? What elements (lighting, colors, shapes, texture, the subject) make you feel that way?

### Symbol/metaphor
A symbol is something that stands for or represents something else besides the thing in itself (e.g., the red, white, and blue pattern that is recognized as the American flag). Can you see any symbols in this photograph? Would they be familiar to other cultures? A metaphor is a comparison drawn between two apparently dissimilar things to show their underlying connection. Is there anything in the photograph that could be read as a metaphor? Is the whole picture a symbol or metaphor for a state of mind or a cultural movement?

### Style
Everyone has got style! Style is attitude; style is taste. Just as you have a taste for certain types of clothes, photographers have likes and dislikes for certain techniques, compositional elements, and working methods. Consider the vantage point of the photograph. How would you describe the attitude the photographer has toward the subject? Look at a series of images by the same photographer. Do you notice similar techniques, common elements in the composition, a
favored tilt to the camera? Can you determine the method and aesthetic of the photographer? Is the style bold and confrontational, or subtle and contemplative? Describe the photographer’s style.

### Genre
Genre is a type or category based on the photograph’s style, content, and intended purpose. Based on the style and content, can you guess what the intended use was for the photograph (e.g., advertising, gallery display, personal photo album)? Can you place the photograph into a genre: portraiture, still life, fashion, documentary, photojournalism, conceptual, narrative, figurative, etc.?

### Artist’s intention/purpose
Without a direct quote from the artist, you can only guess about the artist’s intention. Your observations on intention are based on what you can see in the image and information provided about the techniques used. The style, content, and use of the image indicate its purpose (e.g., magazine illustration, fine art still life). Consider the photographer’s purpose in creating the image. Was the photograph designed for use in a magazine, advertisement, or fine art exhibition?

### Meaning
What is the photograph saying? Viewers arrive at an understanding of the photograph’s meaning through various pathways, which can include their personal responses, knowledge of allusions to artistic traditions, and an evaluation of whether the photograph “works” (i.e., communicates its message). The important thing to remember is that photographers make choices—from among the elements of photography described above—when creating, editing, and producing their images in order to get their message across. By understanding what those elements are and how they work together, viewers can decode the image and interpret its meaning. One of the joys in art is that there are many possible interpretations!
