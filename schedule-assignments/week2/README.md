# Feb 2 • Week 2 • Single Camera

> The task of the cinema and of the camera is not to imitate the human eye, but to see and record what the human eye normally does not see… The camera can function independently, can see in ways that [a human] is not accustomed to--can suggest new points of view and demonstrate how to look at things differently. ([Osip Brik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osip_Brik), “What the Eye Does Not See”, 1926)

## Questions
- What are ways to read and talk about photographs? 
- What are ways to provide feedback on each other’s work that express our interest and curiosity and to promote awareness and discovery in the choices we all make as photographers?
- How can we take photographs on our computers in p5.js (p5) using built-in and external webcams?

## In class
- Share our selected photographs on Miro
- Exercise: What are the elements of a photograph?
- Discuss our weekly review sessions
- Workshop: Taking Photographs in p5.js

## Resources / examples
- Slides
- Elements of a Photograph
- Looking at Photographs
- [Website Demos](https://ellennickles.github.io/demos/) (with video input device example)
- p5 starter sketches (use Chrome)
    - Save canvas with built-in camera
    - External webcam
    - Timer
    - Timer continuous
- [External Webcams](https://tinyurl.com/externalwebcams) in the ITP/IMA ER and software to adjust settings

## Assignment due Tuesday • Feb 8 • 11:59pm
### PART 1 • EXPERIMENT & REFLECT
- The goal this week is to get used to using our laptops to make pictures. It might feel unusual or awkward at first, but the computer and p5 provide opportunities to design our own camera systems. We’ll build on the features over the next few weeks. Play and get to know this image-making device.
- Pick an object at home that you love. 
- Ideally, connect an external camera and use a separate application to adjust the settings to black and white (see [External Webcams](https://tinyurl.com/externalwebcams)).
- Take at least **36 different black and white photographs** of it using your computer’s built-in camera or an external webcam. (Why black and white? Why 36?)
- Each photograph should be visually distinct. Use the [Elements of a Photograph]() from class today if you need inspiration. 
- Post a link to your code and the images on your blog and write a short reflection on your process and results. What do the images show? Why do you like the images? What qualities do you like best (see [Elements of a Photograph]())? What did you have trouble with? What would you do differently next time? Describe the experience of creating the images? What did you feel? What was surprising, enjoyable, or challenging?

### PART 2 • [READ]() & RESPOND
- What is the “decisive moment”? This idea is a recurring theme in photography. Read the Introduction to *The Decisive Moment* by Henri Cartier-Bresson (1952) and an "Interview with Henri Cartier-Bresson from Famous Photographers Tell How (1958)" on American Suburb-X. 
- Select a photograph from the book, *The Decisive Moment* (video content warning: nudity). Take a screenshot of the selected picture, add it to your blog post, and answer the questions in [Looking at Photographs]() to practice reading the elements of a photograph. (HINT: Drop your screenshot into a Google Image Search to find a better version?)

### PREPARE FOR WEEKS 4-5 (Feb 16 and Feb 23)
- During these weeks, we'll use physical computing to create alternative shutter buttons. Here's a checklist to prepare. Especially with current global supply chain issues and shipping delays, please don't wait until the last minute. 
- Gather the following materials
    - Arduino (Uno or Nano 33 IoT depending on when you took Creative Computing)
    - Cables to connect your Arduino to you computer
    - Solderless breadboard
    - Jumper wires
    - Sensor(s) with which you have previous experience or are excited to use (but no buttons or toggle switches!)
    - Resistors and other components required for use with sensor(s) (check The Shop bins!)
    - The [ITP/IMA Equipment Room (ER)]( https://itp.nyu.edu/er/) (NYU login required) has some Arduinos and accessories available for checkout
- Install the following apps
    - [Arduino IDE v1.8.15 or later](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (but not 2.0)
    - [p5.serialcontrol](https://github.com/p5-serial/p5.serialcontrol/releases) (for Macs: Beta 1.2 > Assets > p5.serialcontrol-darwin-x64.zip)
- Install and test your Arduino
    - [Arduino Uno Quickstart Guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-rev3)
    - [Arduino Nano 33 IoT Quickstart Guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-33-iot)
