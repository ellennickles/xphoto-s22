### PART 1 • COMPLETE YOUR FINAL PROJECT

### PART 2 • FINAL DOCUMENTATION
Write your final project documentation in the form of a blog post. It's up to you to figure out how to best document your project. Here are some loose guidelines if you aren't sure what to include:
- **Title** and one-sentence description
- **Link** to project (if online)
- **Project summary** • 250-500 words
- **Inspiration** • How did you become interested in this idea? Quotes, photographs, products, projects, people, music, political events, social ills, etc.
- **Process** • How did you make this? What did you struggle with? What were you able to implement easily and what was difficult?
- **Audience/context** • Who is this for? How will people experience it? Is it interactive? Is it practical? Is it for fun? Is it emotional? Is it to provoke something?
- **Code references** • What examples, tutorials, references did you use to create the project? 
- **Next steps** • If you had more time to work on this, what would you do next?
- If the project is a collaboration, each person is expected to submit a post documenting their contributions.

### PART 3 • PREPARE A PRESENTATION
- Prepare a four (4)-min presentation about your project. Feel free to include any questions to direct feedback after your presentation.  
- If your project is online, be prepared to share a link.
- If your project is a physical object, please bring it to class.
- If your project involves physical interaction, prepare a short video (~2 min) of the experience as a backup.
- HINT: Use your final documentation blog post as an outline.

This assignment is worth ten (10) points: five (5) for the project implementation and five (5) for the documentation and presentation.
