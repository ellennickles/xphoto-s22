# Feb 23 • Week 5 • Alternative Shutter Buttons 2

>When I ask him what’s the first thing he notices when looking back at his photographs, [William] Eggleston again says nothing for a long time. I sit back and watch him, leaving him to think. Eventually, he answers, “I try to study everything about the thing, from every angle,” he places his hand vertically across the page, and then, pointing to different sections, “the way colours work against no colour – those black-and-white areas – which is very important. The subject could be anything. A picture gives it life. As though if it didn’t exist on the page, it would be less.” ("[Looking at Pictures with William Eggleston](https://artreview.com/ar-may-2019-feature-william-eggleston/)," Fi Churchman interview with William Eggleston, ArtReview, May 2019)

## Questions
- How can we start to mindfully add color to our images?
- What are additional ways to work with sensors as alternative shutter buttons?

## Assignment due Tuesday • Feb 22 • 11:59pm
### PART 1 • EXPERIMENT & REFLECT (PARTNERS OPTIONAL)
- Continue to work with sensor triggers and take a series of images, but add color this week. Be deliberate about color choices and placement in the composition. You could focus on one dominant color or work within a color scheme. 
- Work with the same sensor, a new one, or several at time. Continue to consider: how is triggering the capture the result of a change (or inactivity) in the environment or an action (or reaction) of the body? Is the triggering active or passive? How does the choice of sensor and its context in the world contribute to the intentions or expressions of the image? The only rule is: no buttons or toggle switches on your Arduino to trigger captures.
- Choose one of the images to post on your blog. Write a short reflection on your process and results. What does the image show? Why do you like the image? What qualities do you like best (see [Elements of a Photograph](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s22/blob/main/resources/photograph-elements.md))? What did you have trouble with? What would you do differently next time? Describe the experience of creating the images? What did you feel? What was surprising, enjoyable, or challenging?
- If you work with a partner, each person still needs to submit a blog post.

### PART 2 • [READ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1YZtWK03TXGCoGmy7WeQYF-BBulZFAbHA) & RESPOND
- Read “[The Pig and the Algorithm](https://circulationexchange.org/articles/Pig_and_Algorithm.html)” by Kate Palmer Albers  
- Read "[Ways of Machine Seeing](https://unthinking.photography/articles/ways-of-machine-seeing)" by Geoff Cox
- Albers asks: “It’s hardly a newsflash to suggest that words can easily change the meaning of an image, but, at this moment in history, it is worth asking: how do the stakes change when it is a computer, not a human, writing the caption?” Based on the two readings, *what are the stakes?* What is in question when photographs are algorithmically-labeled, organized, and searchable?
- Include at least one (1) question for discussion or further reflection.
