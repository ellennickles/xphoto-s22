# Questions for Discovery

We will use the following questions during our weekly review sessions to draw awareness to our reading of images. What captures your interest and curiosity? Can you sense how you are seeing? Write your responses quickly and freely. Refer to the [Elements of a Photograph](https://github.com/ellennickles/xphoto-s22/blob/main/resources/photograph-elements.md) if you need to. This activity should take about 10 minutes. Keep your observations positive and neutral, no “I like…” or “I don’t like…”. 

1. What do you see in this picture?

2. Can you describe it more?

3. Look away and then look at the photograph again. What catches your eyes first? 

4. Why does it stand out? E.g. describe the shapes, lines, colors, patterns, etc.

5. Where do your eyes go next? Why?

6. What leads your eyes around from place to place? 
Some examples: Is there contrast in lighting, tone, line quality, shapes, size, type of subject matter, or other elements? Is something repeated? Are your eyes following lines? Are you drawn into the work or do you stay on the “surface”?

7. What is the mood of the photograph? How does it make you feel? What does the photograph make you think of? 

8. What is one (1) question that you have about the work? Only positive and neutral questions, for example: "I am still curious about [something] …to me it looks a little more [something] here than over here. Why might that be?" OR "I was wondering about …how [something] got to be this way or …how [some effect] was achieved.”
