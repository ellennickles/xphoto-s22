# Apr 20 • Week 12 • Final Project Proposals

*Subject to updates as projects evolve

## In class
- Present final project proposals
- Discuss upcoming weeks

## Preparing for playtesting next week
- Next week (Week 13) is a opportunity to share a version of your project for feedback.
- Observing how others engage with your project is an incredibly valuable part of the design process to understand what’s working (and not) in order to improve the experience. Sometimes unexpected user questions and interactions provide new insights for developing projects in entirely different directions.
- It's up to you to design your user testing. It can mean something different for each project. For example, it might be more obvious what to do for a website or a publication vs a physical installation. If you are not sure how to design your testing, let me know and we'll figure out some options.
- When testing, show rather than tell your idea as much as possible. The *rule* that we’ll try to adhere to is no explaining of the project until after the user has viewed or interacted with it. So if possible, no special instructions to testers before they start.
- But! If your project is meant for a specific context or audience, then state the minimal amount of information, e.g. where ideally would this project be experienced and who is your audience/user base? (Note that everyone or anyone is not a user base.)

## Assignment due Wednesday • Apr 27 • Start of class
### PART 1 • CREATE A FINAL PROJECT PROTOTYPE
- Come to class with a version of your project to share
    - If you are working on a sequence or series of photographs, bring a rough draft along with other options you are considering including.
    - If your project is a publication, bring a mock-up.
    - If your project is screen-based, be prepared to share a live sketch/site, full-screen if possible.
    - If your project involves some type of physical interaction, ideally bring it to class if you can or show a short video (~2 min)

### PART 2 • DOCUMENT YOUR PROGRESS AND PLAYTESTING PLAN
- Write a blog post about the current state of your project. Note any breakthroughs, frustrations, questions, challenges, additional resources that you are using or need. 
- Include your plan for playtesting next week. Figure out what you want to get out of the session (see above). Prepare some open-ended questions for your testers that focus on specific aspects of your project that you’re unsure of or want to know more about, e.g. “What did you take away from this project?” versus “Do you get that my project is about XYZ?​” 
- If you are working in a group, each person needs to contribute and submit a post documenting their contributions.
- This assignment is worth five (5) points: two (2) for describing your project's progress, two (2) for describing your playtesting plan and questions, and one (1) for submitting the post on time.
